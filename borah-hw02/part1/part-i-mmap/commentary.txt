RESULT:
I found that the memory mapping of this anonymously mapped area of memory was located 
starting at 0x800244000 and ending at 0x800245000. This is lower than the mapping of
the heap.

REASONING:
I copied the contents of wheres-the-heap.c into whither-mmap.c as figured I could retool
much of the functionality. I replaced the malloc with an mmap call using `MAP_ANONYMOUS`
and neither specifying a file descriptor (-1) nor an address (NULL). I then examined the
output, noticing that the output after mmap was larger than before. On closer inspection,
I noticed that a new memory mapping had been created between the two `procstat vm` calls.
I also noticed that the address of p was the same as the starting address of this new 
mapping. Thus, I inferred that this was the new mapping created by my mmap call. And 
comparing this the address of the heap, this mmap address is lower.
