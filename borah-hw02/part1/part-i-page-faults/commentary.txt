COMMENTARY:
I first used the grep command you provided to look at the spots where `vm_fault_trap`
appeared. Looking at the results, I noticed one was a function definition so I checked
out its location in `usr/src/sys/vm/vm_fault.c`. Looking at this function definition,
I noticed familiar things such as SIGSEGV. I then created a both a c and d file to test
things out. In my c file, I planned on doing one successful one and another
unsuccessful. The succesful one would be using mmap and the unsuccessful one would be 
trying to store a character at address 0x0. For my d file, I used `fbt::vm_fault_trap`
to catch the page handler, printing the 1st argument as it is the address that caused
this fault. Upon return, I checked to see if the return value was 0 or not as this
denotes if that fault was handled successfully or not.
