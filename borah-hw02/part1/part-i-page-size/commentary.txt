NAME: Dan Borah

COMMENTARY:
My idea was to retool the program and script I created for the previous exercise to 
assist me in this one. THe general idea is to track page faults using dtrace. I can use
`fbt::vm_fault_trap` entry and return to do so. In particular, I printed the address
causing the page fault when this handler was called as well as the when the handler was
unsuccessful. This way, I could see the page faults and parse out what address created a
segfault. As for my c program, I used mmap to get the MMU to give me a page. Then I 
iterated through an infinite while loop, moving to the next address and assigning a value
there. Eventually, this process would reach a point where it crossed the boundary of the 
page, causing a segfault. My d script notifies me of this and gives me the address.

Overall, my d trace scripts prints out the address of the pagefault created when I call
mmap as well as the address that causes the segfault (which lies at the end of this 
mapping).

REVISION:
Technically, my program worked before. But, I learned I could do it without a page fault.
Instead of only requesting one page, I could request a bunch. Then, starting at the first
one, I could put a value in each byte of memory and more on to the next one. Eventually, 
I would reach the end of this first page. But since I request a large amount of memory, I
have more pages that have contiguous mappings. Thus, around ~4000 increments, I would 
receive a page fault and my dtrace script would show me the virtual address of this fault.
In doing this, I was able to find the size of a page without causing a page fault.
